//! Storage abstraction for the federated catalog cache.
//!
//! Named `rdf-store` because a crawled catalog is expected to eventually be
//! represented as an RDF named graph (one graph per participant), but the
//! [`CatalogCache`] trait itself is backend-agnostic. Which RDF store (or
//! whether RDF at all, vs. e.g. a plain document store) backs this is a
//! decision being made iteratively - see the `dataspace` study repo's
//! `docs/spikes/` for the exploration behind that choice - so this crate
//! only fixes the shape of the trait plus one in-memory implementation
//! good enough to unblock `ds-catalog-broker-rs` and its own tests.
//!
//! The trait mirrors Eclipse EDC's `FederatedCatalogCache` SPI
//! (`save`/`query`/`deleteExpired`/`expireAll`) but adapted to a
//! from-scratch design: EDC's mark-then-sweep expiry (`deleteExpired` +
//! `expireAll` called every crawl tick) is replaced here by an explicit
//! `delete(node)`, since the tick/expiry policy belongs to a future
//! crawler crate, not to the storage trait itself. Like EDC, each
//! participant's crawled catalog is upserted as a whole unit keyed by
//! origin node - not decomposed into per-dataset rows - mirroring EDC's
//! choice to key the whole `Catalog` object graph by origin node URL.
//!
//! ## Intended future backend: Oxigraph
//!
//! A research spike in the `dataspace` study repo (`docs/spikes/`) surveyed
//! the available Rust RDF/quad-store crates against this trait's shape -
//! a named-graph quad store, one graph per
//! crawled source-node IRI, upserted wholesale on crawl, removed via an
//! explicit delete - and recommended **[Oxigraph](https://crates.io/crates/oxigraph)**
//! as the eventual backend:
//!
//! - It is the only surveyed candidate that both matches the shape (named
//!   graphs, full SPARQL 1.1 Query/Update/Federated Query) and has a
//!   maturity track record to build on now: ~8 years old, actively
//!   maintained, ~700k crates.io downloads, dual Apache-2.0/MIT, with a
//!   persistent RocksDB-backed store.
//! - `cool-japan/oxirs` is the closer long-term architectural fit
//!   (async-native, purpose-built on-disk format, also named-graph
//!   capable) but at spike time was a 14-month-old, effectively
//!   single-maintainer workspace whose persistent backend had shipped only
//!   five weeks earlier, with unaudited test/scale claims - not a
//!   foundation to bet this rewrite's first concrete cache backend on.
//! - No other surveyed crate (Sophia, terminusdb-store, hdt, Grafeo,
//!   kglite, rust-rdftk) beat Oxigraph on the combination of shape-fit and
//!   maturity.
//!
//! ## Implemented backend: `oxigraph_backend`, on top of `contreforts-kg`
//!
//! [`oxigraph_backend::OxigraphCatalogCache`] is the real Oxigraph-backed
//! implementation the section above anticipated. It is built on
//! [`contreforts-kg`](https://labs.deepthought-solutions.net/contreforts/contreforts-kg),
//! an existing, actively-maintained internal Oxigraph wrapper
//! (`GraphStore` / `QueryEngine`) from a separate private repo the same
//! owner controls, rather than depending on the bare `oxigraph` crate's
//! `Store` directly. That is a deliberate choice, not an oversight: it
//! reuses store-open, named-graph insert/remove, and SPARQL-evaluation
//! plumbing that already exists and is exercised elsewhere, instead of
//! re-implementing it from scratch here. The tradeoff accepted for that
//! reuse is a coupling to a private, different-domain (knowledge-graph
//! tooling, not dataspaces) repo, vendored as a git submodule (see
//! `vendor/README.md`) - acceptable because `contreforts-kg` is a thin
//! wrapper (this crate still depends on `oxigraph` directly too, pinned to
//! the same `"0.5"` range, to construct `NamedNode`/`Literal`/`Term`
//! values), not because the coupling itself is free.
//!
//! The quad mapping has moved past the original "first cut" blob-JSON
//! bridge (one opaque `catalogJson` literal per graph) to a real RDF
//! decomposition: `Catalog`/`Dataset`/`Distribution`/`DataService` each
//! become their own resource, related by real DCAT object properties, per
//! gap analysis §3.2 (`docs/gap-analysis-2026-08-27.md`). See
//! [`oxigraph_backend`]'s module doc for the exact subject/predicate/object
//! mapping - the ADR-equivalent record this doc comment previously
//! deferred to. `catalog-core::Dataset` now carries a real ODRL `Policy`
//! model (`Dataset.policies`, gap analysis §3.4), harvested from a crawled
//! participant's `odrl:hasPolicy` triples rather than invented, and
//! `oxigraph_backend` preserves it faithfully as real `odrl:` triples too -
//! see that module's own doc comment for the exact mapping, including the
//! deliberate atomic-constraints-only scope cut it inherits from
//! `catalog_core::Constraint`.

/// See this module's own doc comment above ("Implemented backend") for why
/// `contreforts-kg` rather than raw `oxigraph`.
///
/// ## Quad mapping (real RDF decomposition - gap analysis §3.2)
///
/// Reuses [DCAT](http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#) terms wherever a genuine DCAT
/// property/class fits `catalog-core`'s domain model, matching the
/// Dataspace Protocol's own stated approach ("The Catalog Protocol reuses
/// properties from the DCAT and ODRL vocabularies" - `catalog.protocol.md`,
/// "Introduction"). One non-DCAT/ODRL term is reused for the same reason:
/// [Dublin Core Terms](http://purl.org/dc/terms/)' `dct:format`, which is
/// what DCAT/DSP tooling itself actually uses for a `Distribution`'s
/// format (including the real DSP `2025-1` JSON-LD context, which maps its
/// `format` term to `dct:format` - confirmed against this project's own,
/// now-removed `http-api` DSP layer, whose `DspDistribution.format` field
/// serialized under that same context). Everything else with no DCAT/ODRL
/// (or DCTERMS) equivalent falls back to this project's own
/// `https://federated-catalog-rs.internal/ns#` namespace.
///
/// **ODRL terms, real and harvested (gap analysis §3.4).** `catalog-core::Dataset`
/// now carries `policies: Vec<Policy>` - real ODRL policy data derived from
/// a crawled participant's own `odrl:hasPolicy` triples, not the hardcoded
/// placeholder the now-removed `http-api` DSP-serving layer used to emit
/// (see `Policy`'s own doc comment). A read-only catalog broker has no
/// negotiation capability of its own, so "honoring" a harvested policy
/// means preserving it faithfully end to end; this store's half of that is
/// decomposing each `Policy` into real `odrl:` resources and triples
/// (below), exactly the way `Catalog`/`Dataset`/`Distribution`/`DataService`
/// are already decomposed into real `dcat:` ones, rather than folding
/// policy data into the generic `Dataset.properties` bag or an opaque
/// blob.
///
/// **Known limitation, not exercised by any current producer**: only
/// *atomic* ODRL constraints (`odrl:leftOperand`/`odrl:operator`/
/// `odrl:rightOperand` on one constraint resource) are ever written or
/// read here - see `catalog_core::Constraint`'s own doc comment for why
/// nested `odrl:and`/`odrl:or`/`odrl:andSequence`/`odrl:xone` logical
/// constraint groups are out of scope. This store never has to defend
/// against one reaching it: `crawler::parse_catalog_response` skips a
/// constraint of that shape (with a tracing warning), one constraint at a
/// time, before it is ever handed to `write_catalog`. Flagged here for the
/// same reason the rest of this doc flags known gaps honestly, not
/// because it is currently reachable.
///
/// ### Namespaces
///
/// | Prefix | IRI |
/// |---|---|
/// | `dcat:` | `http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#` |
/// | `dct:` | `http://purl.org/dc/terms/` |
/// | `odrl:` | `http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/` |
/// | `rdf:` | `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#` |
/// | `fcns:` (fallback) | `https://federated-catalog-rs.internal/ns#` |
///
/// ### Resource IRIs
///
/// For an origin node whose [`NodeId`] is `<node>` (percent-encoded
/// throughout, so any character the id contains still yields a valid
/// IRI), let `<base>` = `https://federated-catalog-rs.internal/nodes/<node>`:
///
/// - **Named graph** (one per origin node, matching the trait's contract):
///   `<base>`.
/// - **Catalog resource**: `<base>/catalogs/<catalog.id>`.
/// - **Dataset resource**: `<base>/datasets/<dataset.id>`.
/// - **Distribution resource**: `<base>/datasets/<dataset.id>/distributions/<index>`
///   - a distribution has no id of its own in the domain model, so it is
///     identified by its position in `dataset.distributions` instead of a
///     blank node (predictable, queryable IRIs beat blank nodes here, and
///     the index doubles as the ordering key - see "Ordering" below).
/// - **DataService resource**: `<base>/services/<data_service.id>`.
/// - **Policy resource**: `<base>/datasets/<dataset.id>/policies/<index>` -
///   like a distribution, a harvested policy is identified by its position
///   in `dataset.policies` rather than by `Policy.id`: that field is an
///   arbitrary, optional string harvested from the crawl (possibly absent,
///   possibly not IRI-safe), not a trusted identifier this store can mint
///   a resource IRI from. When present it is preserved separately as a
///   literal instead (`fcns:policyId`, see "Triples emitted" below).
/// - **Permission / Prohibition / Obligation resource** (one shape, shared
///   by all three - see [`Rule`]): `<policy>/permissions/<index>`,
///   `<policy>/prohibitions/<index>`, `<policy>/obligations/<index>`
///   respectively. Each list's `<index>` restarts at 0 independently of
///   the other two - they live under different path segments, so a
///   permission and a prohibition at the same position never collide.
/// - **Constraint resource**: `<rule>/constraints/<index>`, where `<rule>`
///   is whichever permission/prohibition/obligation resource IRI the
///   constraint belongs to.
///
/// `Distribution.access_service` is a bare `String` in the domain model,
/// not a typed foreign key - it is resolved to a DataService resource IRI
/// using the exact same `<base>/services/<id>` scheme a real `DataService`
/// would get, so a distribution whose `access_service` matches a data
/// service actually present in the same catalog naturally points at that
/// same resource. A dangling reference (no such service) still round-trips
/// correctly: decoding only ever needs to strip the known prefix and
/// percent-decode the remainder, it never requires the target to exist.
///
/// ### Triples emitted, subject/predicate/object
///
/// For catalog resource `<catalog>`:
/// - `<catalog> rdf:type dcat:Catalog .`
/// - `<catalog> fcns:participantId "<participant_id>"` - only if
///   `Catalog.participant_id` is `Some`. DSP's own `participantId` is a
///   dataspace-specific concept with no DCAT/ODRL equivalent, so it falls
///   back to this project's own namespace per the rule above.
/// - `<catalog> dcat:dataset <dataset> .` - one per `Catalog.datasets`
///   entry (`dcat:dataset` is DCAT's real Catalog-to-Dataset property).
/// - `<catalog> dcat:service <service> .` - one per `Catalog.data_services`
///   entry (`dcat:service`, DCAT3's real Catalog-to-DataService property).
/// - `<catalog> <property-predicate> "<value>"` - one per
///   `Catalog.properties` entry; see "Generic properties" below.
///
/// For each dataset resource `<dataset>` (from `Catalog.datasets`):
/// - `<dataset> rdf:type dcat:Dataset .`
/// - `<dataset> fcns:sequenceIndex "<index>"^^xsd:integer .` - see
///   "Ordering" below.
/// - `<dataset> dcat:distribution <distribution> .` - one per
///   `Dataset.distributions` entry (`dcat:distribution` is DCAT's real
///   Dataset-to-Distribution property).
/// - `<dataset> odrl:hasPolicy <policy> .` - one per `Dataset.policies`
///   entry (`odrl:hasPolicy` is ODRL's real property for attaching a
///   policy to an asset, and the exact term DSP catalogs advertise offers
///   under).
/// - `<dataset> <property-predicate> "<value>"` - one per
///   `Dataset.properties` entry; see "Generic properties" below.
///
/// For each policy resource `<policy>` (from `Dataset.policies`):
/// - `<policy> rdf:type odrl:<Kind> .` - `odrl:Set` / `odrl:Offer` /
///   `odrl:Agreement`, matching `Policy.kind` (see [`PolicyKind`]).
/// - `<policy> fcns:sequenceIndex "<index>"^^xsd:integer .` - see
///   "Ordering" below.
/// - `<policy> fcns:policyId "<id>"` - only if `Policy.id` is `Some`. Not
///   an ODRL term: in a real JSON-LD/RDF reading, a policy's `@id` *is*
///   its subject IRI, but this store already mints its own positional
///   subject IRI for a policy (see "Resource IRIs" above), so the
///   harvested `@id` string needs a separate home to round-trip - there is
///   no DCAT/ODRL term for "this resource's externally-advertised id, kept
///   as a plain literal", so it falls back to this project's own
///   namespace per the "Generic properties" rule below.
/// - `<policy> odrl:assigner "<assigner>"` / `<policy> odrl:assignee "<assignee>"` -
///   only if `Policy.assigner` / `Policy.assignee` is `Some`, as an IRI
///   when the value parses as one (e.g. a DID) or a plain literal
///   otherwise - the same IRI-or-literal treatment `dcat:endpointURL` gets
///   below, for the same reason: ODRL's formal range for both properties
///   is `odrl:Party` (an IRI-identified resource), but a harvested value
///   isn't guaranteed to already be a valid IRI.
/// - `<policy> odrl:permission <rule> .` / `<policy> odrl:prohibition <rule> .` /
///   `<policy> odrl:obligation <rule> .` - one per entry in
///   `Policy.permissions` / `Policy.prohibitions` / `Policy.obligations`
///   respectively (ODRL's real property for each rule kind).
///
/// For each rule resource `<rule>` (a permission/prohibition/obligation,
/// from `Policy.permissions`/`prohibitions`/`obligations`):
/// - `<rule> fcns:sequenceIndex "<index>"^^xsd:integer .`
/// - `<rule> odrl:action ...` - `Rule.action`, IRI-or-literal (ODRL
///   actions are often a bare keyword like `"use"`, but can also be a full
///   IRI, so the same fallback as `dcat:endpointURL`/`odrl:assigner`
///   applies).
/// - `<rule> odrl:constraint <constraint> .` - one per `Rule.constraints`
///   entry.
///
/// For each constraint resource `<constraint>` (from `Rule.constraints`):
/// - `<constraint> fcns:sequenceIndex "<index>"^^xsd:integer .`
/// - `<constraint> odrl:leftOperand ...` - `Constraint.left_operand`,

/// - `<constraint> odrl:operator ...` - `Constraint.operator`,
///   IRI-or-literal.
/// - `<constraint> odrl:rightOperand "<value>"` - `Constraint.right_operand`,
///   **always** a plain literal, never minted as an IRI even when the
///   value happens to parse as one: a `rightOperand` is a value being
///   compared against, not an identifier for another resource, so giving
///   it the IRI-or-literal treatment would change its RDF shape based on
///   incidental string content rather than ODRL semantics.

///   `<base>/services/<access_service>` IRI described above (`dcat:accessService`
///   is DCAT's real Distribution-to-DataService property).
///
/// For each data service resource `<service>` (from `Catalog.data_services`):
/// - `<service> rdf:type dcat:DataService .`
/// - `<service> fcns:sequenceIndex "<index>"^^xsd:integer .`
/// - `<service> dcat:endpointURL <endpoint_url>` (or, if `endpoint_url`
///   does not parse as a valid IRI - untrusted crawled data, not something
///   this store should reject - `"<endpoint_url>"` as a plain literal
///   instead). DCAT defines `dcat:endpointURL`'s range as `rdfs:Resource`,
///   i.e. an IRI, not a literal; since the domain field already holds a
///   URL string, minting it as the object IRI directly (rather than
///   wrapping it in a literal) is the more faithful reading of the real
///   DCAT term.
/// - `<service> dcat:endpointDescription "<endpoint_description>"` - only
///   if `DataService.endpoint_description` is `Some`. Stored as a plain
///   literal rather than an IRI even though DCAT's formal range for this
///   property is also `rdfs:Resource`: this domain field holds free text
///   (e.g. `"dataspace-protocol-http:1.0"`, see `seed_sample_catalog`), not
///   a URL, and DCAT's own usage note allows literal values in practice.
///
/// ### Generic properties (`Catalog.properties` / `Dataset.properties`)
///
/// `catalog-core`'s `properties: BTreeMap<String, String>` is an arbitrary
/// key/value bag - EDC's `Dataset`/`Asset` have the same shape, keyed by
/// whatever property IRI or name the source used. Each entry becomes
/// exactly one triple, `<resource> <predicate> "<value>"`, where
/// `<predicate>` is:
/// - the key itself, reused as-is, **if** it already parses as an absolute
///   IRI (so a crawler that already normalized a key to a real vocabulary
///   term - e.g. `http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#keyword` - gets a genuine
///   triple using that term, not a synthesized one); otherwise
/// - `fcns:property/<percent-encoded key>` - the documented fallback.
///
/// `crawler::collect_datasets_and_services` now populates `Dataset.properties`
/// with a real crawled dataset's optional descriptors (`title`,
/// `description`, `version`, `creatorName`, `thumbnail`, `keywords`, each
/// only when the source DSP JSON actually carries it - see that function's
/// own doc comment) - `POST /api/management/v4/catalogs/request` reads
/// them straight back out through this exact mechanism to populate the
/// real `edc_federated_catalog_client::models::Dataset`'s own optional
/// fields. None of those keys are absolute IRIs, so all of them take the
/// `fcns:property/<key>` fallback path above, not the passthrough one -
/// but whatever ends up in that map, including any future policy-relevant
/// data, is faithfully represented as a triple, never silently dropped.
///
/// **Known limitation, not exercised by any current producer**: a
/// property key that happens to be exactly one of this mapping's own
/// reserved predicate IRIs would collide with this mapping's own
/// structural triples. For `Catalog.properties` and `Dataset.properties`
/// specifically (the only two generic key/value bags in the domain model
/// today - `Policy`/`Rule`/`Constraint` carry no such bag to collide
/// against): `rdf:type`, `dcat:dataset`, `dcat:service`,
/// `dcat:distribution`, `dcat:accessService`, `dcat:endpointURL`,
/// `dcat:endpointDescription`, `dct:format`, `fcns:participantId`,
/// `fcns:sequenceIndex`, and (new with the ODRL mapping above)
/// `odrl:hasPolicy` for `Dataset.properties`. The rest of the ODRL mapping's
/// own structural predicates - `odrl:permission`, `odrl:prohibition`,
/// `odrl:obligation`, `odrl:action`, `odrl:constraint`,
/// `odrl:leftOperand`, `odrl:operator`, `odrl:rightOperand`,
/// `odrl:assigner`, `odrl:assignee`, and `fcns:policyId` - are reserved on
/// `Policy`/`Rule`/`Constraint` resources the same way, but those types
/// have no generic property map at all, so there is nothing for them to
/// collide with today either way. Flagged rather than defended against,
/// since nothing produces a colliding key today.
///
/// **Test-coverage gap, not a functional one**: this crate's own tests
/// prove the generic-properties round trip through a real
/// `OxigraphCatalogCache` (write, then read back) with synthetic keys
/// (e.g. `assetType`), and `ds_catalog_broker_rs`'s own tests prove
/// `title`/`description`/etc. flow correctly from `Dataset.properties`
/// into a real client-deserialized response - but against an
/// `InMemoryCatalogCache`, bypassing this store entirely (see that
/// crate's own `catalog_request_route_response_carries_optional_dataset_descriptors_through_to_the_real_client_type`
/// test). No single automated test currently exercises the full chain -
/// crawler parses a real DSP dataset's `title`/`description`/etc, upserts
/// through *this* store, queries it back out - end to end. The live demo
/// stack (`ds-labs-org/ds-dev-deployment`) does exercise exactly that
/// chain, confirmed manually (real `title`/`description`/`thumbnail`/
/// `keywords` observed in the served response), but that is not a
/// repeatable, CI-enforced proof. Worth closing with a real test, not
/// silently assumed to be covered because the pieces on either side are.
///
/// ### Ordering (`fcns:sequenceIndex`)
///
/// `Catalog.datasets`, `Dataset.distributions`, `Catalog.data_services`,
/// `Dataset.policies`, `Policy.permissions`/`prohibitions`/`obligations`,
/// and `Rule.constraints` are all `Vec`s - order (and, for distributions
/// and constraints, even exact duplicates) is part of `Catalog`'s
/// `PartialEq`, but RDF triples are an unordered set. Each
/// dataset/distribution/data-service/policy/rule/constraint resource
/// therefore carries an explicit `fcns:sequenceIndex` integer literal
/// recording its original position within its own parent list, and
/// `query()` sorts by it when reconstructing each `Vec` - this is pure
/// bookkeeping to make an ordered domain type round-trip through an
/// unordered store faithfully, not domain data, hence the fallback
/// namespace rather than a borrowed vocabulary term (neither DCAT nor ODRL
/// has a concept of list ordering for any of these).
///
/// This also implicitly assumes `Dataset.id` (and `DataService.id`) are
/// unique within one catalog: two datasets sharing an id would collide
/// onto the same `<base>/datasets/<id>` resource. This mirrors real DSP
/// semantics (a JSON-LD node's `@id` is inherently unique - that is what
/// `@id` means) and is not otherwise enforced by `catalog-core::Dataset`.

        ///
        /// SPARQL evaluation is an Oxigraph-specific capability with no
        /// equivalent in [`memory::InMemoryCatalogCache`] (a plain
        /// `HashMap`, not an RDF store at all) - forcing every backend to
        /// implement it would mean either a panic/`Err` stub on the
        /// in-memory side or inventing a query language the in-memory
        /// backend could actually serve, neither of which is worth it for
        /// a backend that exists only to unblock tests and the
        /// no-crawler-configured default (see this crate's module doc).
        /// So this is an inherent method on the concrete
        /// [`OxigraphCatalogCache`] type instead - additive, doesn't touch
        /// the trait's signature at all. The HTTP layer holds an
        /// `Option<Arc<OxigraphCatalogCache>>` alongside its
        /// `Arc<dyn CatalogCache>` and answers "SPARQL not available" (501)
        /// when it's `None`, i.e. whenever the in-memory backend is
        /// running.
        ///
        /// ## Why the whole store, not one named graph, by default
        ///
        /// A crawled catalog's triples live in a per-origin-node named
        /// graph (this module's own "Named graph" mapping above), not the
        /// default graph - so a plain `SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }` with no
        /// `GRAPH` clause would, under SPARQL's normal rules, match only
        /// the (always-empty) default graph and never see any harvested
        /// data at all. That would silently defeat "search everything I've
        /// harvested", the primary use case the gap analysis calls out.
        /// Instead, whenever the query itself does not already specify its
        /// own dataset (no `FROM`/`FROM NAMED`, checked via
        /// `QueryDataset::is_default_dataset`), this method sets the
        /// query's default graph to the union of every named graph in the
        /// store (`QueryDataset::set_default_graph_as_union`) before
        /// executing it - so a plain triple pattern with no `GRAPH` clause
        /// searches every harvested participant's graph at once, which is
        /// what "the whole store" should mean here.
        ///
        /// A caller that wants to scope to one participant still can,
        /// without any bespoke query-param feature, via SPARQL's own
        /// `GRAPH <iri>` clause (the exact graph IRI scheme is documented
        /// above, under "Resource IRIs") - or via the query's own
        /// `FROM`/`FROM NAMED`, which this method leaves untouched when
        /// present (`is_default_dataset()` is only true when the query
        /// didn't specify one itself). That satisfies the gap analysis's
        /// stretch goal ("via SPARQL's own GRAPH clause... rather than a
        /// bespoke query-param feature") without any extra code here.
        ///
        /// ## Why this is inherently read-only
        ///
        /// This method only ever calls [`SparqlEvaluator::parse_query`],
        /// which parses the SPARQL 1.1 **Query** grammar
        /// (`SELECT`/`ASK`/`CONSTRUCT`/`DESCRIBE`) - never

        /// SPARQL. A SPARQL Update string (`INSERT DATA { ... }`,
        /// `DELETE ...`, `LOAD`, `CLEAR`, ...) simply fails to parse as a
        /// Query - it is not reachable through this method at all, not
